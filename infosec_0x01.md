This chapter lists the key concepts to keep in mind and to consider for every applicable situation. Whether it is through an audit assessment, penetration test, code review, firewall implementation etc. these concepts are the cornerstones of it and information security.

#### Confidentiality

As simple as that. an exceprt from ISO27000: "Confidentiality is the property, that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes."; Confidentiality is basically to keep the infromation, or data, available to only those that are supposed to have access to it. In other words, it is keeping information sufficiently secret.

#### Integrity

This aims to maintain the accuracy and completeness of information, or data, so that it is not distorted or modified without being detected. I.e. when calling a database to fetch employee salary information, both the employee and company are eager to ensure the information is accurate and complete. Neither would like to send the wrong sum, or send the salary to the wrong recipient.

#### Availability

While the two first seem to consider retaining the structure of the data, Availability is to ensure the data is available. For any system that relies on data, it has to be available when it is needed. Typical attack on availability are ddos and destruction.
